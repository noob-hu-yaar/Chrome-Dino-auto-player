Almost everyone of us is familiar with this game, famously known as the <b>Chrome Dino Game</b>

I tried to automate the game, using a basic code written in Python Programming language (and its libraries).

One can open the game in Chrome, simply by searching chrome://dino and apply the python model to automate it.

The model works considerably good in playing the game. I am not claiming that the game will go on till an infinite score, but it does go upto a certain level without even touching the keyboard.

<i>PS: The model may have some bugs which I will try to further fix.</i>
